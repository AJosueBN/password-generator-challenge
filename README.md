# week-three-password-generator-challenge Making an application that a user can use to generate a random password based on the criteria they chosen/selected by choice and provides security.

# The code that will be created doing this task will be through JavaScript

# Things I have added/implemented to the task of generating a password :

- Added an another variable as a length which allows this particular value to hold different types of data that is stored inside this variable 
- Added an alert to send a message to the user that the password needs to be between 8 to 128 characters and if it's over or less than the number suggested, you won't be able to generate the password.
